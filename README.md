The project aims to delve into the test results of public schools in New York City (NYC) using Python. Its objective is to pinpoint high-performing schools in math and delve into overall SAT performance across NYC's boroughs. The analysis harnesses Python's pandas library for data handling and seaborn/matplotlib for visualization.
